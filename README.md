# Simple-HTML-CSS

## Create a responsive layout of the main page of a travel agency's blog.
  The page consists of the following parts:
  - header:
    * name of the travel agency;
    * menu;
    * links to the agency's social network profiles.
  - greetings:
    * header;
    * text;
    * button;
    * image.
  - articles:
    * name;
    * text;
    * button;
    * image.
  - gallery:
    * several images.
  - list of benefits:
    * icon;
    * name;
    * description.
  - form for sending a letter:
    * name;
    * email address;
    * phone number;
    * how to contact the sender (email, phone, Telegram);
    * message topic (send your story, join the journey, participate in filming);
    * message;
    * I'm not a robot reCAPTCHA (the user must check the checkbox, this prevents spam);
    * Send button.
  - footer:
    * links to social network profiles;
    * copyright.

  Notice the following:
    - the image in greeting occupies half of the screen width;
    - the image in articles occupies a third of the screen width;
    - at that, the images in the greeting and articles must stretch to the full height of the block (the image can be cut in width);
    - the gallery displays only the images that fit in the page width, that is, a narrower screen must display fewer photos;
    - when hovering over an image in the gallery, the following must appear: arrows on the sides of the gallery and the text on a translucent bar above the image;
    - benefits are separated by lines;
    - links to social network profiles in the footer must become darker when hovered.
